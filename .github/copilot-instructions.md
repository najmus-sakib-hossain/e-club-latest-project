Before doing anything make sure that you understand the project structure and its requirements with all attached files. And create tasklist and finally then complete those tasks one by one systemitically.

This is a laravel intertia react project using shadcn-ui and tailwindcss for ui and zustand, tanstack query for state management and data fetching. And then using zod with react-hook-form for form validation. This is a CMS like project so every frontend pages should should controlable by its admin panel dashboard pages - and there we should put the default input text value as the current frontend page content. So admin can change the content from admin panel and all images should have a preview and when we upload a new image it should replace the old one. Plus when we delete, edit or save something in the admin panel it should show a toast notification for success or error using shadcn-ui sonner and cancel button correctly!
